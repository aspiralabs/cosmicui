# **Core and React Components**

One of the primary goals for this library is ease of use. We value clean markup and a satisfying developer experience and to facilate developers being able to focus on the task at hand versus wrestling with HTML elements or state management.

Because of this very important goal, all of our components try to use core HTML5 semantic elements such `<button>` `<input typ="range" />` and `<progress>` to name a few. The result has given use a set of components that can be used in React, Vue, Angular or a 'vanilla' HTML project, which we call **Core Components**.

Unfortunately, there are some components that just don't have a supported html element for example `<Toast />` and `<Modal />`, or are really only designed to be used in a React environment such as our `Form` component which comes with built in `yup` validation. These are called **React Components**.

All **Core Components** can be used in React and other frameworks, but only **React Components** can be used in React. This will always be mentioned in the documentation.

## **Using Core Components**

Coming Soon

## **Using Core Components in React**

All core components have a React version. Core components can be used in React as the above examples, but it is recommend to use the **React Component** version of every component. There are added benefits and props that help clean up your code and can help develop features faster. See the difference between a checkbox with a label below:

**Plain HTML**

<Canvas>
    <fieldset className="flex gap-2 items-center">
        <input type="checkbox" className="checkbox-primary" />
        <label className="text-sm text-body">I agree to T.O.S</label>
    </fieldset>
</Canvas>

**React Component Version**

<Canvas>
    <Checkbox label="I agree to T.O.S" />
</Canvas>
