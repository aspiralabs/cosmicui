# Introduction

This is a proof of concept component library system that can be used for DDSI projects. This library was designed for React 17.0 and above.

## **Goals**

There are several goals this library tries to accomplish. These are explained in detail down below.

-   Easy to use
-   Lightweight and Responsive
-   Minimal Maintenance
-   Minimal Depedencies

## **Installation**

You will need to have a GitLab Access token to download this package. Once you have your token make sure to save it to your global `.npmrc` file.
You can then install using yarn or npm

```bash
# If using NPM
npm i @ddsi/olaf-ui
```

```bash
# If using Yarn
yarn add @ddsi/olaf-ui
```

## **How we are achieving these goals**

### **Easy To Use**

Many components are _based_ off semantic HTML version. This means that our `Button` component uses the HTML
`<button>` element, and our `Input` component uses the `<input>` under the hood. Various component libraries just
use generic `<div>` elements to make their components, and thus miss out various functionalities HTML has to offer,
and will offer in the future. This library aims to use "vanilla/semantic" html where ever possible.

### **Lightweight and Responsive**

We utilize **TailwindCSS** for styling our components, and we highly recommend utilizing TailwindCSS in your projects but it is not necessary.
TailwindCSS is a utility css framework where each class maps to one css value. For example `flex` maps to `display: flex;` and `mt-4` maps to `margin-top: 1rem;`.
The benefit to this is this library through tree shaking **only ships with what it uses**, and because multiple components may use flex or margins, there is
minimal css as one class is used in many places.

**Tailwind Example (88 character counter)**

```
// element example
<button class="flex p-4">
<input class="p-4">

// output css
.flex { display: flex}
.p-4 {padding: 1rem}
```

**BEM Example (163 character count)**

```
// element example
<button class="header_btn_main">
<input class="form_input_text">

// output css
.header_btn_main {
    display: flex;
    padding: 1rem;
}

.form_input_text {
    padding: 1rem;
}
```

### **Minimal Maintenance**

Because our components use the base html element under the hood we reduce the amount of updates we have to do as HTML standards change.
HTML Html & Javascript features will automatically be available as they release. This means this library and DDSI projects can take immediate
use of new html standards and features without having to update the component package.

### **Minimal Depedencies**

While there are quite a few development depedencies, there are no shipped depedencies with this library.
There is only one required peer dependency (React) and one optional peer dependency (TailwindCSS)

We try to do everything with base html elements, css animations, and only the javascript utilized by React.
