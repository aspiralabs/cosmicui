# Button

This document outlines everything about the button component.

## **General Usage**

Out of the box, the `Button` component works just like a regular HTML button. It can take all the props and attributes of a regular button.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Button>A Nice Button</Button>
</Canvas>

## **Colored Variants**

Using the colors in `tailwind.config.js` we can pass the key in the `variant` prop to change the color of the button to align with our color design.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
    <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
    <Button variant="success">Success</Button>
    <Button variant="error">Error</Button>
    <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
</Canvas>

## **Outlined Buttons**

Add the prop `outlined` to outline the buttons.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Button variant="primary" outlined>
        Primary
    </Button>
</Canvas>

## **Button Icons**

Our button component tries to be as flexible as possible with icons. We allow you to use any icon pack such as FontAwesome, React Icons, Hero Icons etc.
Because every library has different approaches we cannot support everything, but we have generalized the majority of how icons are exported.

You can pass either a `function` or `JSX` version of your icon depending on your library. In the example below `react-icon` supports **both** functional and JSX rendering (see code).

FontAwesome for example does not support both, and can only be used as JSX like so `icon={<FontAwesome icon={faUser} />}`

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Button variant="primary" icon={AiFillHome}>
        Functional
    </Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" icon={<AiFillHome />}>
        JSX
    </Button>
</Canvas>

Icons also support `left` or `right` positioning. By default icons are on the right.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Button variant="ghost" icon={AiFillHome} iconPosition="left">
        Functional
    </Button>
</Canvas>

## **Loading**

Passing `loading` prop will automatically disabled the button and add a spinner.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Button variant="primary" loading>
        Functional
    </Button>
    <Button variant="ghost" loading>
        Functional
    </Button>
</Canvas>
